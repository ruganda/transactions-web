# Transaction Comparision

The concept behind the project is to perform a financial reconciliation between two different  sets of data

• The sample sets of data can be provided on request from `mubaruganda@gmail.com`

• Two files are compared and report on how many transactions match  perfectly, versus transactions which cannot be matched is generated.

• And those transactions which cannot be matched will be reported on, so that a third  party could refer to the report and investigate the exceptions 

• If a transaction cannot be matched perfectly, you should attempt to look for any close matches  and suggest them as possibilities 

• Note that this is *not* a file comparison project, this is a transaction matching/reconciliation  project 

• The results are not stored after the coparison.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
